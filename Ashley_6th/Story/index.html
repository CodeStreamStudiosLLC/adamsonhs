    <p>Anse Source d’Argent, in the south-west of La Digue, has often been described as the most beautiful beach in the world, and it is certainly one of the Seychelles’ most famous attractions. The beautiful mix of turquoise water, golden sand, and impressive boulders makes it a unique prospect worldwide.

Access to Anse Source d’Argent is via the Union Estate, which charges 115 Rupees per person each day for access, however the outcome is well-worth the fee. Besides this initial entrance fee, access to the beach is easy thanks to a number of well-signposted paths.

One of the main reasons for the beach’s popularity, besides its astounding beauty, is its variety of activities. The shallow, clear water, as well as the coral reef protection, means the beach is a great spot for families, and is also perfect for swimming and snorkelling. That said, it can be difficult to swim here at low tide, as the water is extremely shallow, but at high tide, the water is deep enough to swim while still being shallow enough to be safe for most swimmers.</p>
